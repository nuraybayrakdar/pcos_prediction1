What is Pcos? 
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that affects individuals of reproductive age. This syndrome is characterized by an imbalance in the body, leading to higher levels of androgen hormones than usual. Symptoms of PCOS include irregular menstrual cycles, the presence of ovarian cysts (polycystic), excessive hair growth, acne, weight gain, insulin resistance, and mood fluctuations. Diagnosis is typically made through clinical symptoms and laboratory tests, with ultrasound imaging aiding in the identification of ovarian cysts. Treatment aims to manage symptoms and address underlying issues, involving lifestyle changes, hormonal medications, and insulin-sensitizing drugs. PCOS management focuses on improving overall health and, when desired, supporting fertility.
